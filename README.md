The funding request should be presented by the requestor and/or the Building President and discussed at a PTO meeting and subjected to vote.   When motioning a vote for a funding request, the Treasurer should be prepared to report on the projected cash surplus or deficit for the year to determine the feasibility of the request.   
4.	In situations where a fundraiser has netted surplus funds, or the funding direction of a revenue-generating program has not been specifically identified or quantified in the budget approval process, the President may motion for a vote to allocate those funds.    This allocation should be discussed with the Building Staff in advance.  
5.	If “petty cash” is required to make change at a revenue-generating event, the Treasurer is authorized to provide up to $200 without supporting documentation to the Committee Chair.   The $200 must be returned to the Treasurer within the receipts of the event.
6.	In an emergency situation, a President may approve an unbudgeted expenditure of up to $100 without a vote of the Board, not to exceed three separate emergencies within a PTO fiscal year.
