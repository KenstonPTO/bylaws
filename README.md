# FINANCES

## FUNDRAISING
1.	Any activity or event that results in funds collected and deposited into the general account of a Building PTO or PTO Council shall be deemed “fundraising” and is subject to these by-laws.
2.	Fundraising activities need to be communicated and coordinated through the Council Fundraising Chair. Fundraising updates and results should be shared at PTO Council as part of regular building updates. Each spring, Building Presidents and PTO Council President should disclose their fundraising plans for the following school year to PTO Council, including tentative dates, formats and funding directions. Discussion and/or modifications may result.
3.	Membership enrollment shall be considered a fundraiser and shall be managed according to the “MEMBERSHIP AND DUES” section of these by-laws.
4.	In addition to an annual Membership Drive, each Building PTO may conduct one annual fundraiser not to exceed two weeks in active student/staff/parent involvement. All fundraising events/communications need to be approved by the Building Principal.
5.	Other events that generate income can only be conducted if the net profits are used for a specific Building or District goal that has been documented and communicated prior to the event. Examples include Book Fair, One-School-One Book, etc.
6.	Passive Fundraising events are allowed, and the proceeds may be deposited into the general fund, if approved by the PTO Council. A passive fundraiser is one in which an opportunity is provided to families, students, and/or staff that may be easily ignored, does not have an in-school component, and does not require PTO volunteers. These type of fundraisers typically are "match" based where some percentage of money spent is then donated to the PTO. Examples of approved passive fundraisers are: Coke Rewards, BoxTops4Education, School Kids supply drive, Kalahari, restaurant match funding.
7.	Community Sponsorships may be incorporated into fundraising but must be communicated to other Buildings through PTO Council.
8.	If an additional financial need arises a building PTO may present the proposed fundraiser to PTO Council for a vote. Such plans must be confirmed by PTO Council and the Building Principal prior to any activity, preparation or voting at the Building level. Financial need, funding purpose and current fundraising atmosphere in the District are to be considered.
10.	At the request of the Kenston School District, sponsorships may not be referenced on any materials deemed as homework.

## BUDGETS
The PTO Council and each Building PTO Board shall be responsible for maintaining a budget, against which regular expenditures are levied.

2.	Before the close of the school year, the Executive Committee shall develop a draft budget for the following school year. Prior to the start of the school year, the draft should be discussed, amended and approved at a regular meeting by the corresponding Board per the voting requirements in these by-laws. Each line item should be reviewed. Historical data is helpful but should not preclude thoughtful discussion of each program. Each Building budget must then be presented to the Council Treasurer for review and approval.
3.	Each event/program or expense category should have a budgeted line item. Although the individual components of that line do not need to be recorded or approved, the Board should have a general understanding of what types of expenses will be covered by each budget line. Line items without defined purpose or funding direction are not permitted. 
5.	Once approved, budget allocations may be drawn upon freely by the corresponding committee without line item approval. If however, it is discovered that expenditures must exceed budgeted amounts, additional funds may be requested and approved by vote. Commitments or purchases cannot be made until a vote has taken place. Each Committee Chair is to review the balance of their budget allocation at each meeting and, if necessary, request additional funds at that time to avoid last minute votes.
6.	The current board shall leave a cash operating fund on hand for the following year. The exact level of the reserve operating fund to be maintained will be set by the Council Treasurer for each Building during the budgeting process. In general, this value should be equal to the amount needed to fund events and programs that occur prior to collection of the fundraiser.

## EXPENDITURES
Cash outlays will be made by the treasurer when accompanied by proper forms and supporting documentation. Supporting documentation may include receipts, signed contracts, invoices, or purchase order. When these documents are not available, an expenditure may be made at the treasurer’s discretion, subject to approval by the PTO Council Treasurer. An expenditure will be granted under any of the following conditions:
1.	An expense is allocated against a budgeted line, and is less than the remaining budget balance for that line.
2.	An expense falls under a budgeted line, there is not enough budget balance remaining for the expense, but a vote by the Board has occurred approving additional funds in excess of the amount requested.
4.	In situations where a fundraiser has netted surplus funds, the President may motion for a vote to allocate those funds. This allocation should be discussed with the Building Staff in advance. 
5.	If “petty cash” is required to make change at a revenue-generating event, the Treasurer is authorized to provide up to $500 without supporting documentation to the Committee Chair. The $500 must be returned to the Treasurer within the receipts of the event.
6.	In a situation where nominal funds are required to be spent without sufficient time to obtain a Board vote, the Building President may approve an expenditure of up to $100. The President must then submit and present a funding request at the next Board meeting along with supporting documentation. This mechanism may only be used once per year per building.
7.	All expenses for all events must be paid via the allocated Budget/Funding Request as defined above. Personal funds spent in exceedance or in lieu of the Budget are not permitted. 
8.	Donations of items for specific events are acceptable only when they are announced to/requested from the entire Membership. Donations should not exceed an approximate cash value of $25 per person.
9.	Regardless of the above conditions, all expenditures must support the mission of the PTO and be in accordance with these by-laws.

## OUTSIDE FUNDING REQUESTS
Any member of the Kenston community can request the PTO to fund a specific request outside of the existing budget by submitting an Outside Funding Request to the appropriate Building PTO or to PTO Council.

7. Prior to any vote on a funding request, the Treasurer must report on the projected cash surplus or deficit for the year to determine the feasibility of the request.
8. Voting will follow the rules laid out in these by-laws.
